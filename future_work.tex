\section{Potential Future Work}
A future project might entail creating some form of web application that would allow a researcher to classify their own literature as well as literature they are reading and referencing using the proposed taxonomy. 
Ideally such an application would allow other researchers to quickly search based off a selection of subcategories and be provided with a list of literature pertaining to their specific interest. 
This application would also provide insight as to if the taxonomy is missing anything by allowing a user to submit a "not list" subcategory.
