\section{Usefulness}
 Researchers can classify their literature as well as others in the field.
 This will help them gain insight into what detection methods are saturated, where gaps are, whether or not a paper has done a good job defining how to implement their proposed method and how well it does at defining exactly what it is trying to detect and how. 
 A fully monitored system(s) should be able to cover every attack type, thus defining every needed data source for every applicable method, and the tools that can assist.
