\section{Conclusion}
A taxonomy was presented for the classification of cyber anomaly detection literature containing five main categories. 
Those main categories are; environment definition, anomaly type definition, data source definition, detection type definition, and tool definition. 
This taxonomy can be applied to assist the cyber detective in determining what a certain piece of literature is trying to convey. 
Additionally, after enough classifications of the taxonomy, some insight may be made about what subareas are over and under saturated. 
A subset of literature in the field was presented with the taxonomy applied.
